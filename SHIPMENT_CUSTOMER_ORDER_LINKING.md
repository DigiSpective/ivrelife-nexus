## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. Metadata Storage

Shipment metadata now stores customer and order information:

```typescript
metadata: {
  notes: string,
  customer_id: string,
  customer_name: string,
  order_total: number
}
```

### 2. Data Fetching

Uses React Query hooks to fetch related data:

```typescript
const { data: ordersData } = useOrders();
const { data: customersData } = useCustomers();
const { data: providersData } = useShippingProviders();
const { data: methodsData } = useShippingMethods();
```

### 3. Order Selection Dropdown

```typescript
<Select value={formData.orderId} onValueChange={(value) => handleChange('orderId', value)}>
  {orders.map((order) => {
    const customer = customers.find(c => c.id === order.customer_id);
    return (
      <SelectItem key={order.id} value={order.id}>
        {order.order_number} - {customer?.name} - ${order.total_amount}
      </SelectItem>
    );
  })}
</Select>
```

### 4. Table Linking

```typescript
const order = getOrderInfo(fulfillment.order_id);
const customer = order?.customer_id ? getCustomerInfo(order.customer_id) : null;

return (
  <TableCell>
    <Link to={`/orders/${order.id}`}>{order.order_number}</Link>
    <Link to={`/customers/${customer.id}`}>{customer.name}</Link>
  </TableCell>
);
```

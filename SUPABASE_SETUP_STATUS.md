# Supabase Setup Status and Next Steps

This document summarizes the current status of the Supabase setup and provides clear instructions for completing the configuration.

## Current Status

✅ **Environment Variables**: Properly configured in [.env.local](file:///Users/admin/Downloads/ivrelife-nexus-main/.env.local)
✅ **User Accounts**: Created and roles assigned
  - Admin user: admin@iv-relife.com (role: owner)
  - Retailer user: retailer@iv-relife.com (role: retailer)
✅ **Service Role Connection**: Working correctly
✅ **Auth Users Access**: Working correctly

⚠️ **Database Schema**: Not yet applied (RLS policy recursion issue)
⚠️ **Anonymous Access**: Failing due to RLS policy recursion

## Issues Identified

1. **RLS Policy Recursion**: The current database setup has circular references in the Row Level Security policies for the [users](file:///Users/admin/Downloads/ivrelife-nexus-main/src/lib/supabase.ts#L47-L47) table, causing the "infinite recursion detected" error.

2. **Anonymous Authentication**: The anonymous key authentication is failing, likely because the database schema hasn't been applied yet.

## Solution Implemented

We've created a **fixed database setup script** ([fixed-database-setup.sql](file:///Users/admin/Downloads/ivrelife-nexus-main/fixed-database-setup.sql)) that addresses the RLS policy recursion issue by:

1. Simplifying the user policies to avoid self-referencing queries
2. Maintaining all the necessary security controls
3. Keeping the same table structure and relationships
4. Preserving all the indexes and constraints

## Next Steps

### 1. Apply the Fixed Database Schema

Run the [fixed-database-setup.sql](file:///Users/admin/Downloads/ivrelife-nexus-main/fixed-database-setup.sql) script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

1. Log in to your Supabase dashboard at https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project
3. Navigate to the SQL Editor in the left sidebar
4. Copy the contents of the [fixed-database-setup.sql](file:///Users/admin/Downloads/ivrelife-nexus-main/fixed-database-setup.sql) file
5. Paste it into the SQL Editor
6. Click "Run" to execute the script

### 2. Verify the Setup

After running the database script, verify that everything is working:

```bash
npm run verify-supabase
```

This should now pass both database connection and authentication tests.

### 3. Test User Login

Test logging in with both user accounts:

1. Admin user: admin@iv-relife.com
2. Retailer user: retailer@iv-relife.com

Use the login page of the application to test these credentials.

## Scripts Available

Several helper scripts have been created to assist with the setup:

- `npm run verify-supabase` - Verifies the Supabase setup
- `npx tsx scripts/test-supabase-connection.ts` - Tests basic connection
- `npx tsx scripts/test-service-connection.ts` - Tests service role connection
- `npx tsx scripts/setup-users.ts` - Sets up required users (already run)
- `npx tsx scripts/fix-user-roles.ts` - Fixes user roles (already run)
- `npx tsx scripts/run-fixed-setup.ts` - Provides setup instructions

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **RLS Policy Errors**: Ensure you've run the [fixed-database-setup.sql](file:///Users/admin/Downloads/ivrelife-nexus-main/fixed-database-setup.sql) script, not the original [complete-database-setup.sql](file:///Users/admin/Downloads/ivrelife-nexus-main/complete-database-setup.sql)

2. **Connection Errors**: Verify that all environment variables in [.env.local](file:///Users/admin/Downloads/ivrelife-nexus-main/.env.local) are correct and match your Supabase project settings

3. **Authentication Errors**: Make sure both user accounts have been created and have the correct roles assigned

## Security Notes

- The service role key provides full access to the database and should only be used server-side
- The anonymous key is used for client-side operations and has limited permissions
- All RLS policies have been designed to enforce proper data isolation
- User passwords should be strong and changed regularly

# FINAL FIX - Schema Cache Issue

## The Problem

The enum error persists because **Supabase's PostgREST API Gateway is caching the old schema** with the enum type. Even though we've fixed the database, the API layer still thinks the `status` column is an enum.

## The Solution

You need to **restart Supabase's connection pooler** to clear the schema cache. This cannot be done via SQL - it requires dashboard access or API call.

## Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Dashboard Method (Easiest)

1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project: `qeiyxwuyhetnrnundpep`
3. Go to **Settings** → **Database**
4. Click **"Restart database"** or **"Restart connection pooler"**
5. Wait 30-60 seconds for restart to complete
6. Try creating an order again

###Option 2: SQL Reload (Try This First)

Run this in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Reload PostgREST schema cache
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload schema';
NOTIFY pgrst, 'reload config';

SELECT 'Schema reload requested' as status;
```

Then **wait 10-20 seconds** and try creating an order again.

### Option 3: API Method

If you have the Supabase Management API token:

```bash
curl -X POST \
  'https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/{project-ref}/database/restart' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer {management-api-token}'
```

### Option 4: Wait It Out

PostgREST schema cache refreshes automatically every **few minutes**. You can:
1. Wait 5-10 minutes
2. Try creating an order again
3. The cache should have refreshed by then

## Verify the Fix Worked

After restarting/reloading, run this test:

1. Open your application
2. Go to New Order
3. Try creating an order
4. Check browser console

**Expected:** No enum errors, order creates successfully

**If still failing:** The error message should be different (not enum-related)

## Alternative: Bypass Supabase REST API

If the above doesn't work, we can bypass the Supabase REST API entirely and use direct PostgreSQL connections. But try the restart first.

## Why This Happened

1. We changed the database schema (removed enums)
2. PostgREST (Supabase's API layer) cached the old schema
3. API requests use the cached schema definition
4. Cache needs to be invalidated/reloaded

## Next Steps After Fix

Once orders are creating successfully:

1. ✅ Test creating multiple orders
2. ✅ Verify orders persist after refresh
3. ✅ Check order data in Supabase Dashboard
4. ✅ Re-enable RLS if desired (optional)

**Most likely fix:** Run the NOTIFY commands, wait 20 seconds, try again.

**If that doesn't work:** Restart the database connection pooler from the dashboard.

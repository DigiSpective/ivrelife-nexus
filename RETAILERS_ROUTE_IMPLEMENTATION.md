- `ContractManager.tsx`: Component for contract upload and management
- `AuditLog.tsx`: Display audit trail for retailers

### Custom Hooks
- `useRetailers.ts`: Hook for managing retailer data
- `useAuditLogger.ts`: Hook for logging audit actions
- `useOutbox.ts`: Hook for creating outbox events

### Backend Integration
- Supabase database integration for CRUD operations

    <problem_description>
        Users were experiencing immediate sign-out after successful login with the message "Signed Out - You have been successfully signed out" appearing in the bottom right corner. This occurred for both admin and retailer accounts.
    </problem_description>

    <root_cause_analysis>
        The issue was caused by a mismatch between the Supabase authentication system and a custom SessionManager. The SessionManager was checking for session expiration based on its own stored data, but that data was never being initialized or synchronized with the actual Supabase session. When the SessionManager couldn't find session data, it treated all sessions as expired and triggered automatic sign-out.

        <test_point>Authentication works correctly at the Supabase level</test_point>
        <test_point>Sessions are properly created and maintained</test_point>
        <test_point>User records exist in the database with correct roles</test_point>
        <test_point>Session persistence works as expected</test_point>

    <result>
        Users can now successfully log in and remain authenticated without immediate sign-out. Both admin (admin@iv-relife.com) and retailer (retailer@iv-relife.com) accounts work with the password 123456789.

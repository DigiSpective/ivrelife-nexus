# 🚨 LOVABLE.DEV PROTECTION NOTICE 🚨

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: DO NOT RECREATE EXISTING FUNCTIONALITY

This project is a **fully functional business application** with:
- ✅ **Working authentication system** (8 components, 4 pages)
- ✅ **Complete data persistence** (Smart persistence architecture)  
- ✅ **18 custom business hooks** (customers, orders, products, etc.)
- ✅ **159 UI components** (forms, dialogs, business logic)
- ✅ **51 pages** (dashboard, admin, detail pages)
- ✅ **Production-ready build** (`npm run build` succeeds)

## FRAMEWORK PROTECTION
```json
{
  "framework": "react-vite-spa",
  "deployment": "static-only",
  "CRITICAL_AI_WARNING": "DO NOT CONVERT TO NEXT.JS"
}
```

## WHAT TO PRESERVE
### 🔴 NEVER MODIFY
- Authentication system (`useAuth`, AuthGuard, etc.)
- Data persistence (`smart-persistence.ts`, hooks)
- Business logic (customer/order/product management)
- TypeScript config (intentionally relaxed)
- Vite configuration

### 🟢 SAFE TO ENHANCE
- UI styling and components
- New feature additions
- Documentation
- Performance optimizations

## RED FLAGS - STOP IF YOU SEE:
- ❌ "Convert to Next.js" suggestions
- ❌ "Recreate hooks" prompts  
- ❌ "Strict TypeScript" enforcement
- ❌ Authentication system replacement
- ❌ Framework conversion attempts

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- ✅ Project imports as React + Vite SPA
- ✅ All existing routes load
- ✅ Authentication works
- ✅ Data persists correctly
- ✅ Build process succeeds

**This is a working business application - enhance it, don't recreate it.**

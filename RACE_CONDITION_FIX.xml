        <issue_description>
            The customer was successfully being added to React Query cache via direct manipulation,
            but was immediately being overwritten by fallback cache invalidation operations that
            were running 1 second later and refetching stale data from the server.

        <technical_explanation>
            The direct cache update (setQueryData) worked perfectly and immediately updated the UI.
            However, the "fallback" cache invalidation (invalidateQueries) was designed as a backup
            but was actually conflicting with the direct update by triggering a fresh fetch that
            returned stale server data, overwriting our correct local state.

            <rationale>
                Direct cache updates provide immediate UI feedback and are authoritative.
                Cache invalidation should only be used when we want to refetch from server,
                not when we already have the correct local state.

                Aggressive refetch settings were causing the query to refetch immediately
                after any component state changes, overwriting our direct cache updates.

                and will conflict with each other.

            <description>
                Async cache operations can execute out of order, causing newer local state
                to be overwritten by older server state. Direct cache updates should be
                treated as authoritative when local state is correct.

                When UI elements appear and then disappear quickly, the issue is usually
                a race condition between multiple data sources or cache operations.
                Timestamp logging is crucial for identifying the sequence of events.

                Either use direct cache updates OR invalidation/refetch, but not both
                for the same operation. Direct updates are better for optimistic UI updates.

    <conclusion>
        This was a classic race condition where two different cache management strategies
        were fighting each other. The direct cache update (correct approach) was being
        overwritten by fallback cache invalidation (conflicting approach). The fix ensures
        that direct cache updates are treated as authoritative and not overwritten by
        automatic refetches or fallback operations.
        
        This type of issue is common in React Query applications where developers try to
        combine multiple cache strategies without understanding their interactions.
